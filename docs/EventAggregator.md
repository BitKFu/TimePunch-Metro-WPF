# The Event Aggregation 
Using the EventAggregator you can send messages (that means objects) from one sending class of your application to another receiving class, or even to multiple receivers.

The EventAggregator class is used in order to handle mainly two implementation scenarios. The first scenarios is the [Navigation Workflow](NavigationWorkflow) and the second one is the [Inter ViewModel Communication](ViewModelCommunication).

Please read about both, because they are essential for the MVVM based programming model.
