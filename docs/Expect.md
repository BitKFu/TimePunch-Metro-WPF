# What you can expect from it

The TimePunch Metro WPF Library helps you to create Windows Desktop Applications in the Metro Style, like TimePunch itself or Zune.

We are using it in our applications ourself. So you can expect to get good quality code, that will be maintained over time.

## What you can't expect from it

Don't expect code that is 100% error free. We are trying our best to reduce the amount of errors, but in the end it's up to you if you want to use it in productive code. So don't blame us for errors that might occure. It's your decision to use it.
