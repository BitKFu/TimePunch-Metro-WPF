# The guys we want to say "Thank you"

This library has been inspired by many other developers who shared their ideas on the Internet. We took those ideas, enhanced the code when it was necessary and polished it a little bit.

To be concrete, we give kudos to the following people:

* To **Charles Petzold** for his great DatePicker Implementation. We enhanced his solution a little bit and and added mouse support to it. The original solution can be found at [http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/magazine/gg309180.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/magazine/gg309180.aspx)

* To **Jeff Wilcox** for his unforgetable performance ProgressBar article. We took it just as it was and amendet it to work in WPF. You can read his article about the performance ProgressBar at [http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2010/08/performanceprogressbar/](http://www.jeff.wilcox.name/2010/08/performanceprogressbar/)

* To **Colby Africa** for his fundamental work about the Task Bar Docking mechanism. It was a good point to start for our SnappedTransparentWindow implementation.

* To **Dr. WPF** for his implementation of the FaderFrame. It was an eye opener for us to see how the navigation animation could be solved and it was groundwork for the SliderFrame we implemented. Original implementation can be found here: [http://drwpf.com/blog/Portals/0/Code/FaderFrame.cs.txt](http://drwpf.com/blog/Portals/0/Code/FaderFrame.cs.txt)

* To **Samuel Jack** because of his hint for binding the PasswordBox to the view model. Without this we would had to use ugly code behind. For more information read [http://blog.functionalfun.net/2008/06/wpf-passwordbox-and-data-binding.html](http://blog.functionalfun.net/2008/06/wpf-passwordbox-and-data-binding.html)

* To **George Mamaladza** due to his input about processing global mouse and keyboard hooks. This was also essential for the SnappedTransparentWindow implementation. Read about at [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7294/Processing-Global-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Hooks-in-C](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7294/Processing-Global-Mouse-and-Keyboard-Hooks-in-C)

* To **Torsten Kwast** which is a friend of mine and inventor of the EventAggregator class. He's too modest to write a blog about his work, but he's a great developer. So thank you very much for that great piece of code.

* To **Micah Martin** for his great articel about the CommandBindings Extension that enables you to directly bind the ApplicationCommands to the view model.

* Last but not least to **William Han** because of his code sample of the Transparent resizable borderless WPF window which was the template for the TransparentWindow class. Kudos to him [http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/getwpfcodebywillhan/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1578](http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/getwpfcodebywillhan/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=1578)
